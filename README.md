# template-cover-letter-2024

![Preview](preview.png)

This is the LaTeX + Node.js/Python template I created for the cover letters of my faculty job applications in the 2023-24 cycle. 
This framework is the best when (1) you have dozens of similar letters, (2) you want some customization for each, and (3) you want to iterate on the letter multiple times. If you are not thinking about customization or you think you can have a final version soon, you don't need this framework.

Basically, the code automatically generates PDF files for different schools based on a shared template file and all configuration files. You can then find the final PDFs in `letters/pdfs`.



# Setup

To use this framework, you MUST have a local LaTeX/XeLaTeX setup (XeLaTeX for different fonts). Here (https://www.latex-project.org/get/) gives you instructions about different OS. I also recommend a local LaTeX compiler such that you can debug. For macOS, TexMaker is free, and I use a paid one Texifier. 

You need either `Node.js` (https://nodejs.org/en) or Python 3.  I wrote the Node.js script, and I refer to this script below. Thanks to GPT, I got a Python version in 5 seconds. :-)  I tested `generate-letter.py` generated by GPT-4, which seems fine. 


## Basics
- You should replace the content in `fig`.

- `template.tex` is the outline of the whole tex file.  You probably don't need to make major changes to this file. It takes two important input files: 
  
    - `format.tex` This file defines the format. At the very least, you should change the `hookcolor` (around line 19) to your home school color, and change the name and contact (around line 73) to yours.
  
    - `sameforall.tex` As explained by its name, this file defines the share content of the main body (e.g., your degree, research, and teaching) with **customization** placeholders. 
    -  **Customization** placeholders must use **a seperate line**, with a format like `title-line%#title-line`. I will talk about how this works below. Roughly, the Node.js (`letters/generate-letters.js`) script will replace these placeholders with the content in the configuration files, generate a tex file for each school, and compile it. 
 
 -  The `school-customization` folder contains configuration files. If you need to add a school, copy and add a file like `new-school.tex`. 
    
    Each school has its own configuration file, which gives information to fill in the placeholders. The file must follow the following format so that the Node.js file knows the mapping.   
        > %---  
        title-line%#title-line    
        ... 
    
    - If you don't need a customization, don't leave it blank or delete it. Put something like `\vspace{-4pt}` or `{}` there; otherwise, the script doesn't split an entry properly (I was a little lazy when writing the script).
  

- `letters/generate-letters.js` is where the magic happens.
  
   - When you add a new school, you also add the file name (e.g., new-school) to the holder (around line 5). 
   - Run this js file using `node generate-letters.js` (or `python generate-letters.py`) under the same folder.
   - This file reads all files abovementioned, replaces the placeholders with the specification in the school configuraiton, outputs the tex file to `letters`, and compile and move the final PDF file to `letters/pdfs`. 
   - You should see the command line outputs something like 
        > ...   
        total : 3
    - Open `letters/pdfs`, you should see each school's PDF has its own file with appropriate customization.  

- You can add a customization placeholder. But remember that to make sure the script replaces the placeholder in the `sameforall.tex` with the specification in school configuration files, you need to add the same entry to ALL school files (even it's a `{}`)!  Otherwise, the outputted PDF is still the placeholder. 
    
# Debug

If the command line does not terminate, something is wrong. I admit that it is not easy to debug. 

First, you should check if the Node.js file generates tex files in `letters`. 

You then use a local editor (e.g., TexMaker) to open and compile a tex file (e.g., `NEW-SCHOOL-letter.tex`) to diagnose the issues. 

You can also try to upload the tex file to overloaf if you don't want to have a local editor. But having a local editor was the only way to write LaTeX file before overleaf/sharedlatex dominates.....


# Notes

You can find my research statement's template here (https://github.com/Fumeng-Yang/template-research-statement-2024). I use the same font and color. I also advise that these fonts should be the same or similar to your CV font. 

You can change the font in `format.tex` (around line 59, remember to add `ttf` files)!

 The `generate-letters.py` was generated by GPT-4. I am not responsible for any bugs :-).
